Research questions

1. How do the observed and modelled data compare?
2. Which model moe accurately represents the measured results? Why?
3. How do TARTES simulations with Robledano's grain shape compare to spherical and fractal grain shapes? What causes these differences?

# Introduction and Review of Literature

Case study: analysing data from March 19 2021

Motivation: Validation of field spectroscopy measurements as well as preparation for future field campaigns. 

Purpose: comparing the observed and modelled results for surface spectral reflectance.

Literature review
- Based on different data and different methods. HIghlighting the limitations of previous studies
- More recent articles: 10 years old literature

Novelty: 
- The importance of using hyperspectral data for snow albedo data retrieval
    Typically multi channel data are used for albedo retrieval (e.g. MODIS, ASTER, AVHRR)
- A new grain shape algorithm (Robledanoet al., 2023) used in TARTES



# Methods

- Comparing observed spectral reflectance data and modelled data.

## Observed data
- Field spectrometer data ASD Field spec 4
- AVIRIS-NG Surface Spetral Reflectance


## Modelled data

### ISSIA

- Running TARTES in MATLAB

### TARTES

- Running TARTES in Python
- Creating a lookup table to account formissing SSA values



# Results, Discussion, and Conclusions

Answering the researh questions.
